# Project Overview
This project demonstrates my ability to work with real-world datasets using SQL. I imported raw data, performed extensive cleaning and transformation, and solved a variety of SQL challenges including filtering, aggregation, joins, subqueries, and window functions.


# SQL Challenges Solved
- ✅ Filtering and Sorting
- ✅ Aggregations (SUM, AVG, COUNT, etc.)
- ✅ GROUP BY and HAVING clauses
- ✅ JOIN operations (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT)
- ✅ Subqueries and Nested Queries
- ✅ Window Functions (ROW_NUMBER, RANK, etc.)
- ✅ Case Statements and Conditional Logic


# What I Learned
- Hands-on experience with SQL best practices
- How to clean and transform messy data
- How to solve analytical challenges using SQL logic
